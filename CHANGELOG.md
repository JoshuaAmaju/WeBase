Bug fix:

- Fix issue with deleting unmatched items during a match query, due to still holding a reference to unmatched items.
- Fix issue with saving of entire property object in relationship start and end references with actual node ids.
- Pass arguments to where function in query in the order in which the Node aliases (if present) were declared in query.
